This little AppleScript will open your safari webkit console for the running iPhone simulator.

Pretty useful when debugging phonegap apps !

All you have to do :

  - `open iphonesimulator.scpt`
  - *optional :* depending on your language, change `DÃ©veloppement` to `Develop` or whatever the label to the `Develop` menu is in your desktop safari.
  - `File` -> `Export`
  - Choose `Application`, so you can put it in your Dock - that's what I do, but it's up to you
  - Run the application : on first run, it will prompt for rights.
  
  
  
Happy phonegap coding !
